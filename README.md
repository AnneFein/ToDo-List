ToDo List

This is a React application that allows the user to add and remove items from a to do list.

How to Run

This is a React application that runs in the browser. Node.js and npm need to be installed on the user's machine. A "npm start" command must also be used in order to launch the application in the user's default web browser. 
To use the To Do List as a user, simply type into the "Add Todo field" a task that needs to be added to the To Do list. To remove an item that has been completed, click on that item on the list.

Roadmap of Future Improvements

In the future, I would like to add more styling to the To Do list.
